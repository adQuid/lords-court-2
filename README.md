#### Build Process
* Copy assets folder into the out/production folder. Just delete the older folder so that it copies right.
* Build artifact in Intellij
* move jar from out/artifacts into staging folder (outside repo to avoid committing it). jar file, data folder, lib folder, maps folder, save folder, and sound folder need to be on the
same level as the .exe file to work. exe file can be found in the "deployments" folder of this repo.
